#### Course Description:
> Part I is an introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Specific topics covered include: union-find algorithms; basic iterable data types (stack, queues, and bags); sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications; priority queues; binary search trees; red-black trees; hash tables; and symbol-table applications.

> Part II covers graph-processing algorithms, including minimum spanning tree and shortest paths algorithms, and string processing algorithms, including string sorts, tries, substring search, regular expressions, and data compression, and concludes with an overview placing the contents of the course in a larger context.
